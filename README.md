<h2>About 📝</h2>

<p align="center">A project created using ReactJS, TypeScript, Storybook, Tailwind CSS, Jest and Radix. This was developed through Ignite Lab lessons (by Rocketseat), where we developed a design system using Figma to the design stuff and project structure, and the application itself was done using React and its ecosystem! 👊🏼</p>
