<h2>About 📝</h2>

<p align="center">A project created using ReactJS, TypeScript, Storybook, Tailwind CSS, Jest and Radix. This was developed through Ignite Lab lessons (by Rocketseat), where we developed a design system using Figma to the design stuff and project structure, and the application itself was done using React and its ecosystem! 👊🏼</p>

- Could use `yup` to create better validations to inputs
- Could improve the inputs to show error messages
- Could refactor the code to break into smaller components
- Could refactor to use atomic design components structure
- Could use cookies as a way to save my user token
- Could create an API for the sign in
- Could create more pages
- Could improve tests

etc...
